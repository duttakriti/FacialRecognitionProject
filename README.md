# FacialRecognitionProject

Everyday actions are increasingly being handled electronically, instead of pencil and paper or face to face. This growth in electronic transactions result
 in great demand for fast and accurate user identification and authentication. This is a surveillance system service that not only tracks people but also monitors and records their details. Facial Recognition is a Physiological Biometric that requires no physical interaction on behalf of the user. It is accurate and allows for high enrolment and verification rates. It can use our existing hardware infrastructure, like
cameras and image capturing devices. CCTV Facial Recognizer is a surveillance system that seeks to ensure easy tracking of identifiable members within a campus to ensure not only safety but also monitoring. Such a system can be extended to include authentication, registration, sentiment analysis in security, retail, health care, etc.
